In June 1520, at Balinghem, there met the young and glorious Kings of England
and of France in a grand and splendid celebration of their mutual friendship
and admiration. There were great feasts and opulent amusements, conspicuous
expressions of deepest and sincerest piety, and fierce tournaments. Each King
outshone the other in turn, so that the world might be astounded at the wealth
and power of each kingdom. So many tents and raiments were made of precious
cloth of gold, that the field is so named.

<p>
A sort of subversion of the point salad paradigm, The Field of the Cloth of
Gold harkens back to the feel of the classic German games of the 1990s: simple,
elegant, austere, and politely vicious.
